Compact and productive integrated system for drones that combines flight controller (FC) based on powerful STM32F405 microcontroller and 4-in-1 speed controller (ESC) with support up to 20A (25A peak).

Thanks to its small size and high functionality, including built-in OSD, and often also barometer and "black box", it is an ideal choice for creating light and maneuverable FPV drones.
