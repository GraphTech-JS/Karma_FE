Assembling an FPV drone is an exciting process that requires attention to detail and the right approach. This guide will help you build a reliable and efficient drone from scratch.

## Necessary Components

To assemble an FPV drone, you will need:

- **Drone Frame** - the foundation of the structure
- **Flight Controller** - the drone's brain
- **ESC Regulators** - control the motors
- **Motors** - create thrust
- **Propellers** - convert rotation into thrust
- **Battery** - power source
- **FPV Camera** - transmits video
- **Video Transmitter** - transmits the signal
- **Antennas** - for receiving/transmitting the signal

## Preparation for Assembly

Before starting the assembly, make sure:

1.  You have all the necessary components
2.  The workbench is well-lit
3.  The tools are ready for work
4.  The components have been checked for integrity
5.  The documentation is at hand

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### Step 1: Motor Installation

- Install the motors on the frame according to the diagram
- Tighten the bolts with the correct torque
- Check the direction of motor rotation

### Step 2: ESC Installation

- Place the ESCs on the frame with ventilation
- Connect the signal wires to the flight controller
- Secure the ESCs on the frame

## Electrical Connections

Proper connection is the key to success:

**Battery** → PDB → ESC → Motors  
**Flight Controller** → ESC (signal wires)  
**FPV Camera** → Video Transmitter  
**Antennas** → Video Transmitter and Receiver  
**Receiver** → Flight Controller

## Testing and Configuration

- **ESC Calibration** - motor synchronization
- **PID Tuning** - flight stability
- **FPV System Test** - video quality
- **First Flight** - checking all systems

## Expert Tips

**Always remove the propellers** during testing  
**Use high-quality connections** for reliability  
**Check the polarity** of all connections  
**Document your settings** for the future  
**Practice on a simulator** before a real flight
