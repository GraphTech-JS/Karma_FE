FPV (First Person View) flight is an exciting experience that allows you to see the world from the drone's perspective. This guide will help beginners master the basics of FPV flight.

## Basic Principles of FPV Flight

FPV flight is based on several key principles:

- **Spatial Orientation** - understanding the drone's position
- **Speed Control** - smooth control
- **Trajectory Prediction** - planning movement
- **Reaction to Changes** - quick response
- **Flight Safety** - avoiding dangerous situations

## Necessary Equipment

1.  **FPV Goggles** or a monitor for video
2.  **Transmitter** with the correct settings
3.  **A reliable drone** with an FPV system
4.  **Spare batteries** for extended practice

## Training Program

### Stage 1: Simulator

Start with a simulator to master basic skills:

-   -Setting up the transmitter for the simulator

-   -Mastering basic control commands

-   -Practicing spatial orientation

-   -Learning to land and take off

### Stage 2: First Flights

After the simulator, move on to real flights:

-   -Choosing a safe place for flights

-   -Initial flights at low altitude

-   -Practicing basic maneuvers

-   -Learning emergency landing

## Flight Techniques

1.  **Smooth movements** - avoid sharp changes in direction
2.  **Constant attention** - keep an eye on the drone and the surroundings
3.  **Route planning** - think about the trajectory in advance
4.  **Safe distance** - stay away from obstacles

## Flight Safety

-   **Always check the equipment** before flying
-   **Use a spotter** for extra safety
-   **Follow local flight regulations**
-   **Avoid flying over people** and animals
-   **Monitor weather conditions** before flying
