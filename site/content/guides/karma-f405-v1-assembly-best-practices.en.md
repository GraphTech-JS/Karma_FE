<p class="text-center">High-quality installation of equipment, without enlargement, has a
significant role in the reliability of the final product. We have made
a list of the most important aspects when assembling unmanned
systems using Karma equipment and will continue to
systematically add to this list.</p>
<h2>POWER-WIRE CONNECTION</h2>
<p>In any ESC, the zone from the point of connection of the battery wires to the
current-measuring shunts has the highest current density and, therefore, the
greatest heating. Proper wiring has a direct impact on the ESC's ability to meet
or exceed its characteristics. This is due to a whole list of factors.  </p>

<ol>
<li>The current that can pass from both sides will be more evenly distributed into
internal board layers, accordingly, the current to different layers can pass
through the same transition in different ways, reducing heating several times.</li>
<li>Solder resistance adds a minor (about 1oz) to the copper equivalent, although
this is not a significant factor but it does have an effect. </li>
<li>Solder plays a good heat-dissipating role, exactly where it is needed</li>
</ol>

<h2>
ADDITIONAL CAPACITOR

</h2>

<div class="text-center">

</div>

<p>
<strong>For current-intensive modes with constant high or explosive currentindicators, it is crucial to install an additional capacitor.</strong>

No need to modify the legs, just install an additional capacitor directly connected to
the ESC board. When installing two capacitors, it is recommended to connect them
to different sides of the board, this will allow the current to be distributed in
different ways and will have a minor effect on the temperature indicators in the
connection area. Installing an increased capacity also has a positive effect on the
feeling of piloting. 

</p>

<h2>ENHANCED FC POWER LINE</h2>

<p>
The kit includes an additional power supply wire, which increases the permitted FC
current capacity on the BATT line to 2.4A. A standard JST SH connector has a rated
current of 1A, and a 28AWG wire is about 0.8A (silicone 30AWG 0.5A). The flight
controller's power consumption, depending on the installed equipment (Servo,
VTX, etc.), can significantly exceed these numbers. There are cases of loss of power
to the flight controller, especially when the battery voltage drops and the current
rises accordingly. 
</p>

<p><strong>
Do install the wire to increase the reliability of the final assembly.

</strong></p>

<h2>
MOTORS CONNECTION  

</h2>


<p>

Motor wires are the main sources of interference that affect not only the image
quality of the video signal but can also lead to the loss of the drone, regardless of
which stack and which brand you use. In the ESC described stack, the platform for
connecting motors of a larger size is not only to improve the ergonomics of the
assembly but also to encourage engineers to "less noisy assemblies."
</p>
<p>The photo below shows an example of situations that must be avoided. In the given
example, you can see several turns of signal wires that lie directly on the twisted
wires from the motors when the flight controller is mounted. If there is a distance
from the motor wires to the FC directly and interference is transmitted moderately,
then in the example given, a step-up transformer from the motor wires to the ERLS
signal wires is almost built. </p>

<p><strong>
Please do not run motor cables between stack boards.

<h2>
INSTALLATION OF FLIGHT CONTROLLER
</h2>
<p>
To ensure stable operation of the gyroscope on the board, it's crucial to avoid
touching the FC elements to any solid structures. Otherwise, you'll experience
extremely high noise levels, regardless of the controller vendor.

</p>

![EXAMPLE OF EXPECTED DISTANCE WITH CORRECT INSTALLATION](/img/kontroler-good.jpg)

<p>

Included in the Karma Flights controller package are silicone dampers. These not
only possess excellent shock-absorbing properties but also ensure the correct
mounting height of the FC (Flight Controller) to the ESC (Electronic Speed
Controller), preventing connector impacts between the FC and ESC during flight. If
you replace these dampers with any others, make sure that the distance between
the connectors of both boards is at least 1mm.
</p>

<p>

A common installation mistake is over-tightening the nuts on the flight stack, which
completely negates the shock-absorbing capabilities of the damping mounts.

<p style="text-align:left;">A simple device, as shown in the
image below, costs significantly
less than the entire flight stack and
can prevent complete failure of the
device in case of assembly errors or
defects in any of the components.

 <strong>Please, don't neglect using it.</strong>
